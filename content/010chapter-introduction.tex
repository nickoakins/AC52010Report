%    Introduction: An explanation of the problem and the objectives of the project.
%    Background: A (usually brief) review of relevant literature and products to establish the context of the project.
%    Requirements specification: A specification of the problem and an explanation of how the student arrived at this specification. An initial work schedule including an overall project plan with time-scales, deliverables and resources.
%    Design: This should include the design method, design process and outcome. Design decisions and trade-offs should be described e.g. when selecting algorithms, data structures and implementation environments or when designing for usability.
%    Implementation and Testing: A description of production, testing and debugging. A demonstration that the specification has been satisfied.
%    Evaluation: You should carry out formal user evaluations and report on them.
%    A description of the functionality and interfaces of the completed system.
%    Appraisal: A critical appraisal of the project indicating the rationale for design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt during the course of the project and an evaluation (with hindsight) of the final product and the process of its production (including a review of the plan and any deviations from it). The project should be placed in a wider context and this could include the scientific, technical, commercial, social and ethical context.
%    Summary and Conclusions.
%    Recommendations for future work.
